# survey-kit

Survey kit is a Vue ðŸ’š tool aimed to quickly and easily create surveys & quizes. It is aimed to let anyone add surveys ( like google survey ) or quizes to their web apps. We can add surveys within components or as a whole page as needed. 

TODO: `Add more details and instructions`

The current roadmap for `first release` includes all features described in `v1`.

### Features for `v1` ðŸ”¥

* Create surveys easily & fast
* Support for multi-language
* Caches to local storage
* Style freely & quickly
* Quick survey templates

> The plan for v2 is to be able to connect to a DB either by individual hosting or through connection parameters. Then provide a report based on the survey or quiz as a graph or chart.
